            The fund originated from an early classroom discussion concerning the growing accessibility of online
            brokerage accounts and the evolving mechanics of electronic trading. During this period, when 
            digital trading platforms were still developing, an initial investment was executed following 
            student debate and a collective class vote.

          <p>
            The initiative subsequently evolved into a formalized academic project. Students work in teams to select a
            company for comprehensive analysis over the course of the semester, culminating in a detailed presentation
            and investment recommendation delivered to the class. Portfolio inclusion decisions are determined
            exclusively through a class vote.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, participation has expanded to include students primarily from MBA and Executive MBA programs at
            the University of Kentucky, Clemson University, Mercer University, and the University of South Florida.

            Capital contributions began at $1,000 and increased in fixed increments to resemble investors' life cycle. 
            The program now operates with typical annual contributions of $5,000. Allocation decisions including whether to 
            concentrate capital in a single security or diversify across two or more selections are determined collectively
            and solely based on student recommendations and class deliberation.
