            The fund originated from an early classroom discussion concerning the growing accessibility of online
            brokerage accounts and the evolving mechanics of electronic trading. During this formative period, when
            digital trading platforms were still developing, an initial investment was executed following structured
            student debate and a collective class vote.

            The initiative subsequently evolved into a formalized academic program. Students work in teams to select a
            company for comprehensive analysis over the course of the semester, culminating in a detailed presentation
            and investment recommendation delivered to the class. Portfolio inclusion decisions are determined
            exclusively through a class vote.
          </p>

            Over time, participation has expanded to include students primarily from MBA and Executive MBA programs at
            the University of Kentucky, Clemson University, Mercer University, and the University of South Florida.

            Capital contributions began modestly and increased gradually in fixed increments. The program now operates
            with typical annual contributions of $5,000. Allocation decisions — including whether to concentrate capital
            in a single opportunity or diversify across multiple selections — are determined collectively based on
            student recommendations and class deliberation.
