        <p className="homeSubtitle">
          The fund originated from an early classroom discussion concerning the growing accessibility of online brokerage
          accounts and the evolving mechanics of electronic trading. During this formative period, when digital trading
          platforms were still developing, an initial investment was executed following structured student debate and a
          collective class vote.

        <p className="homeSubtitle">
          The initiative subsequently evolved into a formalized academic program. Students work in teams to select a
          company for comprehensive analysis over the course of the semester, culminating in a detailed presentation and
          investment recommendation delivered to the class. Portfolio inclusion decisions are determined exclusively
          through a class vote.
        </p>

        <p className="homeSubtitle">
          Over time, participation has expanded to include students primarily from MBA and Executive MBA programs at the
          University of Kentucky, Clemson University, Mercer University, and the University of South Florida.

          Capital contributions began modestly and increased gradually in fixed increments. The program now operates with
          typical annual contributions of $5,000. Allocation decisions — including whether to concentrate capital in a
          single opportunity or diversify across multiple selections — are determined collectively based on student
          recommendations and class deliberation.
